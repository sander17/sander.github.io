I experienced how to produce films, learned techniques on camera movements and angles, and gain more confidence on camera. Junior year was when I started to take on this academy, I was a little behind from my other classmates because majority of the the other students with me had more experience with computer techniques since they already took it sophomore year. But as time went on, I learned to adapt. I started to practice the rules of shoulder to shoulder, 90 degree rule, and many other more when position a person on the screen of the camera. I started to use that skill in my outside class photography, like when I post photos on my Instagram account, what I learned in the the academy applies. I also learned the movement of camera, like panning. Whenever I feel like being artistic in my Snapchat, my knowledge on camera movement also applies. My interest in the skills that I gained are used in every work that I do, including communication skills and how I could spread messages using videos. With this great knowledge, since I have always volunteered myself to be on the camera because my other teammates would rather not, I always step up, and ever since being the actor for our project films, I realized that I was also interested in acting and being in the performing arts. My experience with the Arts and Media Entertainment academy helped me figure out what kind of work that I enjoy doing, and I look forward to spending more time in film productions.\r\n\r\n![My designed graphic puma logo](http://burton-sfusd-ca.schoolloop.com/uimg/file/1249846178618/5342940253070424314.jpg?1457549592266)\r\n\r\n###Contact\r\nEmail: zambranosander@gmail.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
